A small notebook analyzing some Chicago's crime stats, based on a csv file of Chicago's crimes available here:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

I also use 2010 Census data, available here:

## To do

Normalize months by length of month (this is a no-brainer, I just haven't done it)
