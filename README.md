A small notebook analyzing some Chicago's crime stats, based on a csv file of Chicago's crimes available here:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

I also use 2010 Census data, available here:
https://datahub.cmap.illinois.gov/dataset/2010-census-data-summarized-to-chicago-community-areas

Some interactive visualizations are located here: http://elaadapplebaum.com/visualizations

In [notebooks](notebooks) you'll find some analyses. In [figures](figures), unsurprisingly, some figures, though these are best seen in context in the notebooks. In [web](web) you'll find code for generating the interactive visualizations, though I'm still getting around to hosting them properly.

## To do

Many many things! I add to this when I can, but there are many things I'd like to add that I haven't yet. If you have any questions or requests, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:elaad.applebaum@gmail.com).
